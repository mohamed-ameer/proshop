(Q)What is JWT?
==================
*First of all,in web development, there're many different ways to authenticate users.
You can use cookies, sessions, Json web tokens or a combination, and there's other services like OAuth(Google,Facebook,...).
A Json web token is a secure way to share information between two parties, such as a web server and a client.
JWT consists of three parts a header, a payload and a signature.
=> the payload contains user's information like the user's ID or the user's role.
=> the signature is used to verify that the information hasn't been tampered with in any way.
So JWT s are commonly used for authentication, which is the process of verifying a user's identity.
-------------------------------------
*usually, Json web tokens often get stored in the browser on the client,
hence,we would send a token and then we'd store that token in our local storage on the client and then send
that token to any protected routes where we had to be logged in, where we had to authenticate.
BUT that's not the best way to do this, it can be insecure because you are storing it on the client, so you open yourself up to cross-site scripting attacks.
-------------------------------------
*what we're going to do is we're going to generate a Json web token,
then we're going to store it in an Http only cookie on the server.
So we're going to write some middleware that will basically, once we authenticate or we register,
it'll create the token, store it in an Http only cookie, and then that will get sent with every request from then on.
in short it's not going to be stored in our browser in local storage, which makes it much safer.
